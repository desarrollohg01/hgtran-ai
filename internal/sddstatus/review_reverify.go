// review_reverify.go is Wave 4 S6 (design.md's "Amendment (coordinator-
// resolved): targeted re-verify call site", 2026-08-03): targeted
// re-verify is a routing decision owned by internal/sddstatus's Resolve()/
// resolveEngramStatus(), mirroring the post-verify offer's own call-site
// resolution (decision 3's amendment) -- the routing surface owns
// integration, the orchestrator consumes it, RunSDDVerifyValidate stays
// context-free. It fires only when the change's governing receipt (S5c''s
// resolveGoverningReceiptRef path) records an applied review correction,
// and is purely additive/informational: it never mutates Dependencies or
// NextRecommended itself, the same non-invasive shape Status.ReviewOffer
// already established.
//
// Data-source note (recorded explicitly, matching the amendment's own
// permission): the terminal CompactReceipt SDDReceiptRef points at carries
// no correction changed-path data at all -- only an opaque FixDeltaHash.
// Extending that schema is explicitly out of scope for this amendment. The
// real, already-existing source used instead is the full CompactState
// loaded from the same lineage's compact authoritative store (the same
// store resolveCompactRemediationAuthority's sibling code path already
// loads for remediation purposes):
// CorrectionAttempts[last].Snapshot.Paths. Whenever that is empty or
// absent, branch 7.2 (not reliably derivable) is what fires -- expected to
// be the common case in production until a future wave (Wave 5 or 7, per
// the amendment's Open Questions) revisits the receipt shape to carry
// correction-path data directly.
//
// "Verify evidence scope" is approximated by the compact authority's own
// GenesisPaths narrowed to the openspec/changes/<changeName>/ prefix -- the
// same prefix check compactAuthorityPathsBound (review_gate.go) already
// uses to prove a compact authority is bound to this SDD change. This is a
// deliberate, investigated choice, not an arbitrary one: reviewtransaction's
// own state machine validates every correction attempt's changed paths as a
// SUBSET of the full GenesisPaths (confirmed empirically while building
// this slice's own test fixture -- store.Replace refused a correction path
// outside GenesisPaths with "compact correction attempt is outside frozen
// scope"), so using the FULL GenesisPaths as the evidence-scope side would
// make branch 7.1's empty intersection structurally unreachable (correction
// paths ⊆ GenesisPaths always, so their intersection with GenesisPaths
// itself is never empty unless the correction paths are themselves empty --
// already branch 7.2's territory). Narrowing to the OpenSpec planning-
// artifact slice of GenesisPaths keeps a genuine, meaningful three-way
// split: a correction confined to ordinary source files (the common case)
// leaves nothing about WHAT verify checks changed -- empty intersection,
// branch 7.1; a correction that also touches specs/tasks/design/proposal
// under this change's own openspec path might have changed what verify
// needs to prove -- non-empty intersection, full re-verify. No already-
// exported path-diff primitive exists from RuntimeObjective's candidate-
// tree pair without new reviewtransaction plumbing, which is out of scope
// for this slice.

// (blockArchiveForUnsatisfiedReVerify, cycle 3's own task 5 addition): the

// clearing it (a livelock), and the only existing write path capable of
// recording satisfaction (`sdd-attempt finish
// --remediates-evidence-revision`) requires `--expected-binding-revision`
// and `--successor-lineage` together -- a full review round trip, which

// for. See design.md's "Amendment (corrective verify cycle 3): re-verify
